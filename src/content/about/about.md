Hey, I'm <mark>Fauzan</mark> - a software engineer who turns technical excellence into business impact.

I've built and scaled products used by <mark>thousands</mark>, automated pipelines that save teams <mark>countless hours</mark>, mentored over <mark>180 engineers</mark>, and helped grow tech communities along the way. Whether it's shipping apps, improving workflows, or empowering people, I focus on creating <mark>leverage that compounds</mark>.

What drives me? The intersection of <mark>**engineering craft and business outcomes**</mark>. I don't just want to write elegant code; I want to see it <mark>move metrics, unlock growth, and make teams more effective</mark>.

Beyond engineering, I run <mark>Kokuhaku Hobby</mark> — a hobby shop for collectibles, action figures, books, and games — and I founded and lead a <mark>500+ member</mark> gaming community.
