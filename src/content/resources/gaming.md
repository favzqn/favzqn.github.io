### Current Obsession

**Baldur's Gate 3**  
100+ hours in and still discovering new content. The depth of choice and consequence is unmatched. Playing as a Paladin/Warlock multiclass because apparently I enjoy making morally questionable pacts while pretending to be righteous. Every playthrough feels different, mostly because I keep restarting after 20 hours.

### All-Time Favorites

**The Witcher 3**  
Best storytelling in gaming. The DLCs are better than most full games. Spent more time playing Gwent than the actual main quest. No regrets.

**Hades**  
Perfect roguelike gameplay loop. "Just one more run" turned into 100+ hours. The soundtrack slaps so hard I listen to it while coding.

**Portal 2**  
Puzzle perfection. Still the gold standard for puzzle games. GLaDOS's insults are more creative than most standup comedy.

**Civilization VI**  
"Just one more turn..." Famous last words at 3 AM. Then 4 AM. Then sunrise. Gandhi's nuclear aggression is a feature, not a bug.

**Yakuza Series**  
The perfect blend of serious crime drama and absolute chaos. One moment you're dealing with yakuza politics, the next you're managing a cabaret club or racing toy cars. Kiryu has never killed anyone (officially). The Yakuza 0 soundtrack is legendaryâ€”Friday Night is my productivity anthem.

**Cyberpunk 2077**  
After the updates, this game became what it was meant to be. Night City is breathtaking, the story hits hard, and the soundtrack is pure cyberpunk perfection.

**RimWorld**  
The ultimate colony sim where every playthrough tells a unique story. War crimes simulator disguised as a management game. The emergent storytelling is unmatched.

**XCOM Series**  
Tactical perfection meets crushing difficulty. 99% hit chance? You'll still miss. 1% enemy hit chance? Headshot, instant death, your best soldier. The RNG gods are cruel. The tension of every decision makes it endlessly replayable.

### Why I Game

Gaming isn't just entertainmentâ€”it's:
- **Problem solving** under pressure
- **Strategic thinking** in complex systems  
- **Stress relief** after debugging production issues
- **Storytelling** that rivals any other medium

Plus, it keeps the custom PC build justified for "development purposes" ðŸ˜‰
