### 🏋️ Fitness & Health

**Strength Training** • 3x/week  
Push/Pull/Legs split with compounds: squat, bench, deadlift, overhead press.

**Daily Walking**  
Essential part of my routine. Clears my head, helps me think through problems, and keeps me sane.

**Why**  
Strong body → clear mind. Hard to write good code if you feel awful.
