### The Beat-Up Old Dusty Drum

It started as a joke, really.
Buried in a bulk shipment of Japanese action figures and vintage games was this chunky, brown & white plastic drum — a Donkey Konga controller for the Nintendo GameCube. I almost tossed it aside. Who would want this outdated rhythm game accessory in 2025?

But hey, I listed it anyway. "For the meme," I thought.

Then it sold in two days — <mark>for eight times what I'd paid</mark>.

### The Madness of Niche Markets

Turns out Donkey Konga drums are <mark>weirdly sought-after</mark>:

- **Speedrunners** needed them for record attempts
- **Millennials** were drowning in 2000s nostalgia
- **Collectors** building "obscure Nintendo peripherals" shrines

This wasn't a fluke. Since then, I've learned:

1. <mark>"Useless" items often have secret fanbases</mark> (See: The Hello Kitty toaster that started a bidding war)

2. <mark>Nostalgia is the ultimate pricing hack</mark> (Especially for things people thought they'd outgrown)

3. <mark>Never judge demand by your own tastes</mark> (My storage unit is full of "why would anyone — oh wait, sold already?")

### The Takeaway

Now when I import, I don't ask _"Is this valuable?"_

I ask: <mark>"Does this spark someone's joy?"</mark>

Because in the end, <mark>we're not selling plastic — we're selling time machines</mark>.

(Even if the time machine is a goofy monkey drum… or a grease-stained Pokémon card.)
