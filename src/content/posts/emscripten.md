<mark>WebAssembly (Wasm)</mark> has emerged as a powerful tool for bringing high-performance, low-level code to the web. With its ability to <mark>run at near-native speed</mark> in web browsers, WebAssembly opens up exciting possibilities for web development. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll explore how to leverage <mark>Emscripten</mark>, a popular toolchain for compiling C/C++ code to WebAssembly.

### What is WebAssembly?

> WebAssembly is a <mark>binary instruction format</mark> that serves as a compilation target for programming languages. It allows developers to run code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust on the web with <mark>near-native performance</mark>.

**Key characteristics:**
- Unlike JavaScript, WebAssembly is **not human-readable**
- Designed to be **compact and efficient** for transmission over the network

### What is Emscripten?

> Emscripten is an <mark>open-source toolchain</mark> for compiling C and C++ code into WebAssembly, along with accompanying JavaScript glue code to integrate with web applications.

It provides a **bridge** between these low-level languages and the web platform, enabling developers to:
- Port existing codebases to the web
- Write new high-performance code for web deployment

### Getting Started:

**1. Install Emscripten**

The first step is to install Emscripten on your development machine. You can follow the installation instructions provided in the official Emscripten documentation ([https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/index.html](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/index.html)).

**2. Write Your C/C++ Code**

Once Emscripten is installed, you can start writing your C or C++ code. For demonstration purposes, let's create a simple "Hello, World!" program in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, WebAssembly!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**3. Compile to WebAssembly**

Use the Emscripten compiler (<mark>`emcc`</mark>) to compile your C/C++ code to WebAssembly. Navigate to the directory containing your source code and run the following command:

```bash
emcc hello.c -o hello.html
```

> This command will generate three files: `hello.html`, `hello.js`, and `hello.wasm`

**4. Test Your Application with `emrun`**

Instead of manually opening the HTML file in a browser, you can use <mark>`emrun`</mark> to simplify the testing process. First, navigate to the directory containing your `hello.html` file, then run:

```bash
emrun --no_browser --port 8080 .
```

This command will start a local web server. You can then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/hello.html` to see **"Hello, WebAssembly!"** printed!
