## Development Setup

The tools and gear I use daily to build software and stay productive.

### üíª Hardware

**MacBook Pro 14" M1** ‚Ä¢ 16GB RAM ‚Ä¢ 1TB SSD  
Daily driver for work. Handles Docker containers, multiple IDEs, and 50+ Chrome tabs like they're nothing.

**Custom PC Build**  
- **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 5600G
- **Motherboard:** ASRock B550M Pro4
- **RAM:** 8GB DDR4
- **Storage:** Team MP33 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD
- **Use:** Development, testing, and Baldur's Gate 3 (priorities in that order... mostly)

**Custom NAS/Media Server** ‚Ä¢ Old Set Top Box  
Repurposed hardware running Plex, Jellyfin, and various Docker services. Because why buy expensive NAS when you can build one?

**Lenovo 24" Monitor** ‚Ä¢ 1920x1080  
Gets the job done. Nothing fancy, just reliable.

**Audio Setup**  
- **Headphones:** Moondrop Space Travel ‚Ä¢ Deep focus mode activated
- **IEMs:** KZ with custom cabling ‚Ä¢ Because stock cables are never long enough

### üõ†Ô∏è Software & Tools

**Editor:** Visual Studio Code + Windsurf
<br>Extensions: Prettier, ESLint, GitLens, Docker, Remote SSH

**Browser:** Chrome + Arc Browser  
Spaces feature keeps work and personal browsing organized. Built-in ad blocker and split view are fantastic.

**API Testing:** Postman  
For when you need to test APIs without writing code (but let's be honest, automation is better)

**Database:** DBeaver  
Free, cross-platform, and handles every database I throw at it.

**Design:** Figma  
For wireframes, mockups, and collaborating with designers

**Notes:** Obsidian  
Markdown-based knowledge management. Perfect for technical documentation and linking ideas.

**Task Management:** JIRA/Trello  
JIRA for work (because enterprise), Trello for personal projects (because simple)

### üß™ Testing & Automation

**Playwright** ‚Ä¢ End-to-end testing framework  
My go-to for web automation. Fast, reliable, and great developer experience.

**K6** ‚Ä¢ Load testing  
Performance testing and API load testing. Easy to write tests in JavaScript.

**Docker** ‚Ä¢ Containerization  
Everything runs in containers. Makes environment setup reproducible and deployment predictable.

**Jenkins + GitHub Actions** ‚Ä¢ CI/CD  
Jenkins for complex enterprise pipelines, GitHub Actions for simpler workflows

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud & Infrastructure

**AWS** ‚Ä¢ Primary cloud provider  
EC2, S3, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch.

**Netlify** ‚Ä¢ Static site hosting  
This site runs on Netlify. Deploy previews and instant rollbacks are incredible.
